# Memorize helper

A simple program to learn a language or anything else that has keys mapped to values. Clone the repo and from the same directory, run "memorize.py {file_name} {reverse flag}"

If I was trying to learn Spanish:
Filename: spanish.csv
hola, hello
a menudo, frequently
more spanish, more english

If reverse flag is 0, you will be given spanish words and asked for english. If reverse flag is 1, you will be given english words and asked for the spanish.
